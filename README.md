# ACNBookmarks

This repository contains a curated bookmark HTML file (`ACNBookmarks.html`) designed for internal business use. It provides a collection of important and frequently used URLs relevant to company operations. The file is updated periodically to reflect changes in business systems, applications, and portals.

## 🔗 What Is This?

`ACNBookmarks.html` is a browser-compatible bookmark export file. You can import it into your Microsoft Edge browser on a Windows machine to quickly access all relevant internal links in one place.

## 📥 How to Download

1. Visit the file directly:
   [ACNBookmarks.html](https://github.com/andrew-welch/ACNBookmarks/raw/main/content/ACNBookmarks.html)

2. Right-click anywhere on the page and choose:
   **"Save As..."** or **"Save Page As..."**

3. Save the file somewhere easy to find, like your **Downloads** or **Desktop** folder.

Make sure the file saves with the `.html` extension — e.g. `ACNBookmarks.html`.

## 🌐 How to Import into Microsoft Edge

1. Open **Microsoft Edge**.

2. Click the **three dots (⋯)** in the top-right corner.

3. Go to **Favorites** > **Manage favorites**.

4. In the top-right, click the **three-dot menu (⋯)** again and select **Import favorites**.

5. In the "Import from" dropdown, choose **Favorites or bookmarks HTML file**.

6. Click **Choose file**, then browse to the `ACNBookmarks.html` file you saved earlier.

7. Click **Open**.

8. You should now see a new folder in your bookmarks or favorites bar called **Imported** or **ACNBookmarks**, containing all the links.

## 🔄 Updating Bookmarks

When a new version of the bookmark file is published:

- Repeat the download and import steps above.
- Edge will create a new folder with the latest set of bookmarks. You can delete the older one if needed.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

- If the file opens in the browser instead of downloading, **right-click the link** and choose **"Save link as..."**.
- Ensure the file extension remains `.html` — not `.txt` or `.htm`.

## 📌 Notes

- These bookmarks are intended for internal use.
- URLs may be updated over time to reflect changes in business applications or systems.
- Bookmark organization reflects commonly used categories within the company.
